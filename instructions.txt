To connect Django with an AWS S3 bucket, you'll need to configure your Django settings, install required packages, and use them to interact with S3. This involves setting up an S3 bucket, creating an IAM user with appropriate permissions, obtaining access keys, configuring Django's settings.py file, and then using the django-storages package to store and retrieve files from S3. 
Steps:
Set up an S3 bucket in AWS:
Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the S3 service.
Create a new bucket.
Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for your bucket, allowing requests from your Django application (e.g., from all origins). 
Set up an IAM user and obtain access keys:
Navigate to the IAM service.
Create a new IAM user.
Attach an IAM policy that allows the user to access your S3 bucket (e.g., AmazonS3FullAccess or a more restrictive policy). 
Create an access key for the IAM user.
Store the access key ID and secret access key securely (you'll need them for configuring Django). 
Configure Django's settings.py file:
Install django-storages and boto3: 
Code

        pip install django-storages boto3
Add django-storages to your INSTALLED_APPS. 
Python

        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            # ...
            'storages',
        ]
Configure S3 settings. 
Python

        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_NAME'
        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'YOUR_BUCKET_REGION'
        AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
        AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = 'public-read'  # Optional, for public access
Configure the storage backend. 
Python

        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3.S3Storage'
        STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3.S3Storage'
Use django-storages in your Django models or views: 
When you want to upload a file to S3, use the django-storages package's S3Storage backend. 
For example, in a Django model:
Python

        from django.db import models
        from storages.backends.s3 import S3Storage

        class MyModel(models.Model):
            image = models.ImageField(upload_to='my_images/', storage=S3Storage())
            # ...
To retrieve a file from S3, you can use the url attribute of the ImageField or other file fields that use S3Storage. 
Retrieve data from S3:
You can use boto3 directly or the django-storages backend to retrieve files from S3.
For example, to get a file's contents:
Python

        import boto3

        s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
        response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=BUCKET_NAME, Key=OBJECT_KEY)
        file_contents = response['Body'].read()
